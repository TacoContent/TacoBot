**Key Addition:**

```markdown
> **Phase 2 Update (2025-10-15)**: Markdown helper functions consolidated from `coverage.py`
> into reusable utilities. The `build_markdown_summary()` in `cli.py` now uses these helpers
> to eliminate code duplication and enhance the markdown summary with 5 additional coverage sections.
```

## 📊 Documentation Improvements

### Coverage

- **Before Phase 3**: Phase 2 completion undocumented
- **After Phase 3**: Complete documentation trail showing:
  - Initial visualization enhancements (Phase 1)
  - Helper consolidation work (Phase 2)
  - Test coverage improvements (59 new tests)
  - Benefits and outcomes clearly stated

### Traceability

- ✅ COVERAGE_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md - High-level plan with phase status
- ✅ COVERAGE_CONSOLIDATION_PHASE2_SUMMARY.md - Detailed Phase 2 implementation
- ✅ COVERAGE_CONSOLIDATION_PHASE3_SUMMARY.md - This document (Phase 3 summary)
- ✅ COVERAGE_VISUALIZATION_ENHANCEMENTS.md - Technical documentation updated
- ✅ COVERAGE_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md - User-facing summary updated

### Knowledge Transfer

Documentation now provides:

1. **Historical Context**: Why the consolidation was needed (code duplication)
2. **Implementation Details**: What was changed and how (8 helpers, 5 sections)
3. **Testing Evidence**: Proof of quality (283 tests passing, 59 new)
4. **Benefits Achieved**: Tangible outcomes (reduced duplication, enhanced coverage)
5. **Future Reference**: Complete trail for maintenance and enhancement
