# Coverage & Config Improvements Changelog

## Summary
This document tracks the enhancements made to the swagger_sync coverage system and configuration handling.

---

## Feature: Markdown Format Integration
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

### Changes
- **Removed** `markdown` as a standalone coverage output format
- **Enhanced** markdown summary to include comprehensive coverage information (8 sections):
  1. Overall coverage statistics
  2. Coverage by endpoint method
  3. Top 10 most-documented endpoints
  4. Top 10 least-documented endpoints
  5. Endpoints missing documentation
  6. Swagger-only endpoints (orphaned)
  7. Coverage trend (visual bar chart)
  8. Orphaned components summary

### Files Modified
- `scripts/swagger_sync/config_schema.json` - Removed 'markdown' from enum
- `scripts/swagger_sync/cli.py` - Enhanced markdown summary generation
- `scripts/swagger_sync/coverage.py` - Removed markdown report generation
- `docs/http/SYNCING_OPENAPI_SPEC.md` - Updated documentation

## Feature: XML/Cobertura Format Equivalence
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

### Changes
- **Added** `xml` as a valid coverage format option
- **Normalized** xml and cobertura formats to be equivalent
- **Implemented** auto-extension logic for coverage reports:
  - `json` → `.json`
  - `text` → `.txt`
  - `cobertura`/`xml` → `.xml`
  - User-provided extensions are preserved

### New Functions
- `normalize_coverage_format()` - Converts 'xml' to 'cobertura' internally
- `ensure_coverage_report_extension()` - Auto-adds appropriate file extension

### Files Modified
- `scripts/swagger_sync/config_schema.json` - Added 'xml' to enum
- `scripts/swagger_sync/cli.py` - Added format normalization and auto-extension
- `scripts/swagger_sync/config.py` - Implemented helper functions
- `tests/test_swagger_sync_config.py` - Added 14 new tests

### Examples
```yaml
# Both formats are equivalent
coverage_format: cobertura
coverage_format: xml

# Auto-extension examples
coverage_report: coverage        # → coverage.xml
coverage_report: report.txt      # → report.txt (preserved)
coverage_report: data            # → data.json (if format is json)
```

## Bug Fix: NoneType Error with Null Config Values
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Problem
When environment configs set nested structures to `null` (e.g., `output: null` for quiet mode), the config merge system raised:
```
❌ Config error: 'NoneType' object does not support item assignment
```

### Root Cause
The `merge_cli_args()` function only checked `if 'output' not in result:` but didn't handle cases where `result['output']` was explicitly set to `None` by environment overrides.

### Solution
**Two-part fix:**

1. **CLI iteration** (`cli.py` lines 183-192):
   ```python
   # Added None checks before .items() calls
   if hasattr(value, 'items') and value is not None:
       for k, v in value.items():
           # ...
   ```

2. **merge_cli_args initialization** (`config.py` lines 339-343):
   ```python
   # Changed from:
   if 'output' not in result:
       result['output'] = {}
   
   # To:
   if 'output' not in result or result['output'] is None:
       result['output'] = {}
   ```

### Files Modified
- `scripts/swagger_sync/cli.py` - Added None checks in iteration
- `scripts/swagger_sync/config.py` - Enhanced merge_cli_args initialization
- `tests/test_swagger_sync_config.py` - Added test for None value handling

### Verification
All environments tested successfully:
- ✅ `quiet` (output: null)
- ✅ `ci` (with badge and markdown_summary)
- ✅ `local` (custom show_orphans)
- ✅ `default` (base config)

## Bug Fix: Test Unpacking Mismatch
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Problem
`test_output_directory_relative_and_absolute` failed with:
```
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)
```

### Root Cause
`_compute_coverage()` was modified to return 4 values (added `orphaned_components`), but the test only unpacked 3.

### Solution
Updated test to unpack all 4 return values:
```python
summary, endpoint_records, swagger_only, orphaned_components = _compute_coverage(...)
```

### Files Modified
- `tests/test_swagger_sync_output_directory.py` - Fixed unpacking

---

## Bug Fix: Mode Flag Navigation Error
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Problem
Runtime error: `'str' object does not support item assignment`

### Root Cause
Mode flags (check/fix) were being processed inconsistently:
1. `check=True` set `mode='check'` (string)
2. `fix=False` tried to navigate into the string 'check'

### Solution
Modified `merge_cli_args()` to always skip mode flags after processing with `continue` statement.

### Files Modified
- `scripts/swagger_sync/config.py` - Added continue after mode flag processing

---

## Test Coverage
**Total Tests**: 170 swagger_sync tests  
**Config Tests**: 57 tests (14 new for format helpers)  
**Status**: ✅ All passing

### New Test Coverage
- Format normalization (xml → cobertura)
- Auto-extension logic (all formats)
- User extension preservation
- Case-insensitive extension matching
- None value handling in config merge

---

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/http/SYNCING_OPENAPI_SPEC.md` - Updated with xml/cobertura examples
- `docs/scripts/CHANGELOG-coverage-improvements.md` - This file

---

## Backward Compatibility
✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing configs with `cobertura` continue to work
- Existing coverage report filenames are honored
- All environments and test suites pass

---

## Performance Impact
- **Negligible** - Helper functions are simple string operations
- Format normalization adds ~1 function call per execution
- Auto-extension adds ~1 function call per execution

---

## Future Enhancements
Consider for future sessions:
- [ ] Support for HTML coverage format
- [ ] Coverage diff between runs
- [ ] Configurable markdown summary sections
- [ ] Coverage trends over time
