# Test Model Restructuring Summary

## What Was Done

The example models for testing `@openapi_deprecated()` and `@openapi_exclude()` decorators have been moved from the production model directory to the test fixtures area.

## Changes Made

### Files Moved/Created

- ✅ **Created**: `tests/tmp_test_models.py` - Consolidated test models
  - Contains `ExampleDeprecatedModel` (demonstrates deprecated decorator)
  - Contains `ExampleExcludedModel` (demonstrates exclude decorator)
  - Follows existing `tmp_*` naming convention used in other test files

- ❌ **Deleted**: `bot/lib/models/ExampleDeprecatedModel.py`
- ❌ **Deleted**: `bot/lib/models/ExampleExcludedModel.py`

### Swagger File Updated

- ✅ **Removed**: `ExampleDeprecatedModel` schema from `.swagger.v1.yaml`
  - Test models should not pollute production OpenAPI spec
  - Model count reduced from 28 to 27 (production only)

### Tests Updated

- ✅ **Created**: `tests/test_swagger_sync_tmp_test_models.py`
  - Integration test verifying test models work from tests directory
  - Verification that test models don't appear in production scans
  - 2 new passing tests

### Documentation Updated

- ✅ **Updated**: `docs/http/swagger_sync.md`
  - Added note pointing to `tests/tmp_test_models.py` for examples
  - Clarified these are test-only models

- ✅ **Updated**: `docs/http/openapi_deprecation_enhancement.md`
  - Updated file paths to reflect new location
  - Updated test counts (54 tests, 68 total)
  - Updated model counts (27 production models)
  - Clarified test model isolation strategy

## Why This Is Better

### Before (❌ Problems)

``` text
bot/lib/models/
├── ExampleDeprecatedModel.py    # Test fixture in production code!
├── ExampleExcludedModel.py      # Test fixture in production code!
└── ... actual production models
```

- Test models mixed with production code
- Swagger contained test schemas (ExampleDeprecatedModel)
- Could be accidentally imported by production code
- Unclear these were test-only

### After (✅ Improved)

``` text
tests/
├── tmp_test_models.py           # Clear test fixture location
├── test_swagger_sync_tmp_test_models.py  # Tests for test models
└── ... other test files

bot/lib/models/
└── ... only production models
```

- Test models isolated in tests directory
- Follows existing `tmp_*` pattern (see `test_swagger_sync_collect.py`)
- Cannot be accidentally imported by production code
- Clear naming indicates test-only usage
- Production swagger is clean (no test schemas)

## Test Results

### All Tests Pass

```bash
pytest tests/ -x
# 68 passed in 126.88s ✓

pytest tests/ -k "swagger_sync"
# 54 passed, 14 deselected ✓
```

### Swagger Validation

```bash
python scripts/swagger_sync.py --check --strict
# Swagger paths are in sync with handlers ✓
# Model components generated: 27 ✓
# No drift detected ✓
```

### New Integration Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_swagger_sync_tmp_test_models.py -v
# test_tmp_test_models_in_tests_directory PASSED ✓
# test_tmp_test_models_not_in_production_models PASSED ✓
```

## How Test Models Are Used

### During Testing

Tests can scan the tests directory to verify decorator behavior:

```python
models_root = pathlib.Path('tests')
comps = collect_model_components(models_root)
# ExampleDeprecatedModel appears with x-tacobot-deprecated: true
# ExampleExcludedModel does NOT appear (excluded)
```

### During Production Swagger Sync

Production swagger sync uses default models root:

```bash
python scripts/swagger_sync.py --check --models-root=bot/lib/models
# Test models are NOT scanned
# Only production models appear in swagger
```

## Pattern Consistency

This follows the established pattern used in other tests:

| Test File | Test Fixture Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `test_swagger_sync_collect.py` | Creates `tests/tmp_handlers/` directory |
| `test_swagger_sync_method_rooted.py` | Creates `tests/tmp_handlers/` directory |
| `test_swagger_sync_strict_validation.py` | Creates `tests/tmp_handlers/` directory |
| **`test_swagger_sync_tmp_test_models.py`** | **Uses `tests/tmp_test_models.py` file** |

The `tmp_*` prefix is a clear convention indicating temporary/test-only fixtures.

## Benefits Summary

1. ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Test fixtures isolated from production code
2. ✅ **Clean Swagger**: Production spec contains only production models
3. ✅ **Pattern Consistency**: Follows existing `tmp_*` convention
4. ✅ **Prevent Accidents**: Cannot accidentally import test models in production
5. ✅ **Clear Intent**: File location and name clearly indicate test-only usage
6. ✅ **Maintainability**: Easy to find and update test fixtures
7. ✅ **Documentation**: Example usage clearly documented as test-only

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify test models exist in tests
ls tests/tmp_test_models.py  # ✓

# Verify test models NOT in production
ls bot/lib/models/Example*.py  # Should fail ✓

# Verify tests pass
pytest tests/test_swagger_sync_tmp_test_models.py  # 2 passed ✓

# Verify swagger is clean
grep -i "ExampleDeprecated" .swagger.v1.yaml  # No matches ✓

# Verify production swagger sync
python scripts/swagger_sync.py --check --strict  # No drift ✓
```
